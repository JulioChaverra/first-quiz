Review the codebase to ensure there are no SQL injection vulnerabilities in your Python backend, especially when interacting with the MySQL database. Implement prepared statements or use object-relational mapping to mitigate SQL injection risks.

Ensure that strong password policies are in place for customer accounts stored in the MySQL database. Implement multi-factor authentication for customer accounts to add an additional layer of security. Periodically audit authentication and session management mechanisms for vulnerabilities.

Encrypt sensitive data, especially customer information, stored in the MySQL database. Ensure that data is transmitted securely between the mobile app, web frontend, and the Python backend using HTTPS. Implement proper access controls to restrict unauthorized access to customer data.

Implement role-based access control to limit what different types of users can access or modify within the app. Regularly test and review the access controls to ensure they are effective.

Ensure Kubernetes containers, AWS services, and the app itself are configured securely and follow best practices for securing the environment. Regularly scan for misconfigurations, and implement automated tools to help identify and fix potential issues.

Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks in the web frontend, which is built with Next.js. Use content security policies (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.

Review the code for any potential insecure deserialization vulnerabilities in the Python backend. If applicable, consider using a safe serialization format and library.

Regularly monitor and update dependencies used in your app, including libraries, frameworks, and Kubernetes components, to address known security vulnerabilities. Use tools like dependency checkers to identify outdated and vulnerable components.

Limit access to sensitive information in the MySQL database to only the necessary personnel. Implement proper access controls for employees, ensuring that they only have access to the resources they need to perform their job duties.
